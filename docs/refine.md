### Particle refined localization module
For the refinement step, MiLoPYP learns to localize proteins of interests with high accuracy, when trained using sparsely annotated data. This step can be used without the previous exploration step. 

### Input preparation
Training set should include two files: 1. a `.txt` file with tomogram name and path to tomogram; 2. a `.txt` file with image name and its corresponding x,y,z coordinates.

- __If use refinement module after exploration module__, we can use the same train image file and the generated train coordinates file from the exploration module. 

- __If use refinement module alone__, some manual labeling is needed to generate training coordinates. A corresponding train image file is needed as well. 

For 1, the text file should have the following format:

```
image_name   rec_path 	

tomo1 	path_to_tomo1

tomo2 	path_to_tomo2 
...
```

For 2, the text file should have the following format:

```
image_name	x_coord	y_coord	z_coord  

tomo1	125	38	60 

tomo1	130	45	80
...
```

#### Generate training set from manual label

We provide a simple code to generate the described training set from a selected folder. 

First, make a train directory for all training 3d tomograms and its corresponding coordinates files. Each micrograph should have its own coordinate file: e.g. train_1_img.rec and train_1_img_coord.txt 

For training coordinates, manually picking is performed on selected micrographs using imod. For a single tomogram, a full annotation is not required. Simply find some subregions and pick around 10\% to 70\% of the particles in that subregion. The subregion does not need to be big.  After manual annotation, imod will generate ```.mod``` files for annotated coordinates. Converting ```.mod``` files to ```.txt``` files can be done through ```model2point``` command from imod. A sample command is:
```
model2point input.mod input.txt 
```
Once all the ```.mod``` files are converted to text files, move all coordinate.txt files to the train directory. 

!!! warning 

	Depends on the x-y-z order of your input tomogram, the output coodinates generated using imod will be in different order. Two most common orders are `x-y-z` and `x-z-y`. Make sure you get the orders correct. 


Once all the ```.mod``` files are converted to text files, move all coordinate.txt files to the train directory. 

To generate train image and coordinate files, run ```generate_train_files.py``` file under `utils/` folder. Two input arguments are required: ```-d/--dir``` for path to train directory, and ```-o/--out``` for output training file name. The default order for input coordinates is ```x-z-y```, if you want to specify a different order, add ```-r/--ord```. Accepted orders are: xyz, xzy, zxy.  An example command:

```
python generate_train_files.py -e .rec -d sample_data -o sample_run -r xyz 
```

All outputs will be saved to ```exp/semi/exp_id``` folder. For this command, outputs will be saved to ```exp/semi/sample_refinement```. Within folder, there will be: 

 - ```opt.txt``` which saves all the option you used. 
 - ``` debug``` folder, which saves all validation output. 
 - ```model_xxx.pth``` model checkpoint, the final model weights will be ```modelxxx_last_contrastive.pth```. 
 - A directory with specific training/validation loss info for each run

!!! question "How to select which model to use and cutoff threshold score for output?"

    Model and cutoff  threshold score can be selected based on validation loss and outputs in `debug` folder. 
    === "Model selection"

        When there is fully labeled tomogram for validation, typically select the model with the lowest validation loss. 
        When there is no fully labeled tomogram, select the model that generates best heatmaps. 
        Typically, unless there's severe overfitting, model from the last epoch generates good results. 

    === "Cutoff Threshold Selection"

        Cutoff threshold selection can be estimated based on detection output (a `.txt` file that contains x,y,z coordinates and corresponding detection score). It can also be estimated from `*_pred_out.png` images within `debug` fodler that circles out identified particles above a certain cutoff threshold. If there are many false positives, consider using a higher cutoff score. 

### Inference
Once training is finished, we can use the trained model for testing. `test_img.txt` that contains all tomograms can be generated using `generate_train_files.py` following similar process. To run inference on all tomograms, run:
```
python test.py semi --arch unet_5 --dataset semi --exp_id sample_refinement --load_model exp/semi/sample_refinement/model_4.pth --down_ratio 2 --K 900 --ord xzy --out_thresh 0.2 --test_img_txt test_img.txt --compress --gauss 0.8 --out_id all_out
```
Outputs are saved to `exp/semi/sample_refinement/all_out/` folder. For each tomogram, 2 outputs are generated:
 
- `.txt` file with coordinates in x,z,y order, if `--with_score` in command, a score column will be added to the output 
- `*hm.mrc` a 3D detection heatmap for each tomogram.

|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `load_model` | path to trained model, the command here is using model from 4th epoch                                                  |
| `out_thresh`       | cutoff score for detection                                                                   |
| `out_id`  | folder to save all outputs                                                               |
| `ord`     | order of the tomogram  |
| `with_score`     | whether generated output will include score in addition to x,y,z coordinates  |

!!! warning

	Make sure to use same `--last_k`, `--gauss`, `--arch` to make sure correct loading of models.

#### Convert output txt to `.mod` for imod
Make usre output txt files do not include score. Then, run:
```
point2model -scat -sphere 5 output.txt output.mod
```
More details on [imod](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/man/point2model.html) command. 

__Output coordinates from trained model can then by used for subtomogram extraction and averaging and subsequent 3D reconstruction.__
