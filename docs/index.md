# Getting Started

MiLoPYP is an open source, dataset-specific contrastive learning-based framework that enables two-step fast molecular pattern visualization followed by accurate protein localization without the need of any human annotation. During the exploration step, it learns an embedding space for 3D macromolecules such that similar structures are grouped together while dissimilar ones are separated. The embedding space is then projected into 2D and 3D which allows easy identification of the distribution of macromolecular structures across an entire dataset. During the refinement step, examples of proteins identified during the exploration step are selected and MiLoPYP learns to localize these proteins with high accuracy. 


Each step can be used separately. If to use refinement step only (tomogram particle detection), ground truth training coordinates need to be provided. Typically, around 200 coordinates from several tomograms are needed to ensure performance. Training coordinates can be obtained either through exploration step or manually. 

## Installation

The code was tested on CentOS Stream version 8.0, with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) Python 3.8 and [PyTorch]((http://pytorch.org/)) version 1.11.0 and cu 10.2. NVIDIA GPUs with 32GB RAMs are needed for training and inference can be performed on either GPU or CPU. 

After install Anaconda: 

0. [Optional but recommended] create a new conda environment. 

    ```
    conda create --name TomoPick python=3.8
    ```
    
    And activate the environment.
    
    ```
    conda activate TomoPick
    ```

1. Clone this repo:

    ```
    TomoPick_ROOT=/path/to/clone/TomoPick 
    ```

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/$TomoPick_ROOT
    ```

2. Install the requirements

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install pytorch

    ```
    pip install torch==1.11.0+cu102 torchvision==0.12.0+cu102 torchaudio==0.11.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102
    ```

4. Install TomoPick package and dependencies (If shows error, try go to one level above): 

    ```
    pip install -e cet_pick
    ```
